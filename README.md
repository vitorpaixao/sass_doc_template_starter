# Basic Bootstrap 4 Template

This is the basic starter project for [Bootstrap 4](http://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/). It includes a Sass compiler and a starter HTML file for you.

## Installation

To use this template, your computer needs:

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) (0.12 or greater)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

This template can be installed with the Bootstrap CLI, or downloaded and set up manually.

### Using the CLI

Install the Bootstrap CLI with this command:

```bash
npm install bootstrap-cli --global
```

Use this command to set up a blank Bootstrap 4 project with this template:

```bash
bootstrap new --template basic
```

The CLI will prompt you to give your project a name. The template will be downloaded into a folder with this name.

### Manual Setup

To manually set up the template, first download it with Git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bassjobsen/bootstrap-basic-template projectname
```

Then open the folder in your command line, and install the needed dependencies:

```bash
cd projectname
npm install
```

Finally, run `npm start` to run the Sass compiler. It will re-run every time you save a Sass file.
